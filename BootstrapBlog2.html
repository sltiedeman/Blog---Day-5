				           		My name is Stephen Tiedemann and this is my blog.  I used to be a proprietary day trader but after nearly 14 years of that I got pretty burned out on it.  Since I have always been interested in technology I started looking into a career as a web developer.  The amount of information to learn is very daunting but it is also an exciting challenge.  After doing some at home study for the past few months I have taken the full plunge into a 16 week immersive full-stack web development course.  This is the end of my first week at Digital Crafts.  And while I can't say this blog looks amazing, I can say it certainly looks much better than anything I would have made just a few days ago.  For me, that is pretty exciting.

				           		The fact you are reading this post must mean you have absolutely nothing important to do today.  The first one was pretty boring and this one is only going to be worse.  The main purpose of it is filler so that my site is not just a page of random characters.  It has been approximately 5 minutes since my last post.  In that period of time I have taken a swig of water, searched the web for CSS tricks, and contemplated going to the bathroom for the first time since I have gotten to school.  I'm also getting hungry and that is now becoming my most pressing concern.
