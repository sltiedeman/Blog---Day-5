					My name is Stephen Tiedemann and this is my blog.  I used to be a proprietary day trader but after nearly 14 years of that I got pretty burned out on it.  Since I have always been interested in technology I started looking into a career as a web developer.  The amount of information to learn is very daunting but it is also an exciting challenge.  After doing some at home study for the past few months I have taken the full plunge into a 16 week immersive full-stack web development course.  This is the end of my first week at Digital Crafts.  And while I can't say this blog looks amazing, I can say it certainly looks much better than anything I would have made just a few days ago.  For me, that is pretty exciting.

						<h3>My Second Post</h3>

						The fact you are reading this post must mean you have absolutely nothing important to do today.  The first one was pretty boring and this one is only going to be worse.  The main purpose of it is filler so that my site is not just a page of random characters.  It has been approximately 5 minutes since my last post.  In that period of time I have taken a swig of water, searched the web for CSS tricks, and contemplated going to the bathroom for the first time since I have gotten to school.  I'm also getting hungry and that is now becoming my most pressing concern.

						<h3>My Last Trip</h3>

						So this is my third and final post for the day.  For the first time ever we have a guest writer, Bob.  Actually we don't have a guest writer but it looks lame to only have my name on the site.  Anyways, I officially have enough content to fill an entire page and that is enough work for me.  To finish out this post I am going to talk about my last vacation which I took just before starting this 4 month torture session.  I went to an exotic locale that is probably unfamiliar to most, except for perhaps the  most adventurous traveler.  I went to a little-known place called Cancun, Mexico. Actually, I went a bit outside of that area which makes it even more exotic.  My wife, Saray (official Intro later) accompanied me for an 8 day adventure filled with lots of sleeping, pool lounging, occasional ocean splashing, and of course a food and alcohol orgy.  It was a nice time and when I left I was well rested and ready to learn to code.
